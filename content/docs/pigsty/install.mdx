description: how to install pigsty on your linux machine?
---

Prepare a fresh `x86_64/aarch64` node that runs any compatible Linux OS Distros, then Download Pigsty with:

```bash title="download"
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.io/get | bash; cd ~/pigsty;
```

You can run the optional bootstrap and configure to install ansible and generate pigsty.yml config file.

Next, run the `install.yml` playbook with an admin user (nopass ssh & sudo):

```bash title="~/pigsty"
./bootstrap; ./configure; ./install.yml
```

bootstrap: OPTIONAL, make sure ansible is installed, and use offline package /tmp/pkg.tgz if applicable
configure: OPTIONAL, recommend & generate pigsty.yml config according to your env.
install.yml: REQUIRED, install Pigsty modules according to your config file.
It may take several minutes to complete the installation according to your network speed and hardware spec.

After that, you will get a pigsty singleton node ready, with Web service on port 80/443 and Postgres on port 5432.

BTW: If you feel Pigsty is too complicated, you can consider the [Slim Installation](slim), which only installs the necessary components for HA PostgreSQL clusters.
