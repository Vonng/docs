This is a quick reference for the preparation work before installing Pigsty.

--------

## Node

Pigsty currently runs on nodes with `Linux` kernel and `x86_64` / `aarch64` architecture.

A "**node**" refers to a resource that is SSH accessible and offers a bare Linux OS environment.
It could be a physical machine, a virtual machine, or a OS-like container equipped with `systemd`, `sudo` and `sshd`.

It requires at least <span className="text-xl font-black"> 1 </span> node to deploy pigsty,
You can prepare more and setup everything in one-pass, or add them later.
The minimum node spec requirement is `1C1G`, it is recommended to use at least `2C4G`.
Higher is better, with no upper limit. Parameters will be automatically tuned based on available resource.

<Callout title="Leverate IaC tools for node provisoning">

    Pigsty has built-in [**Terraform**](/docs/setup/terraform) and [**Vagrant**](/docs/setup/vagrant) support, to help you create VM nodes easily.

</Callout>

<Callout title="Use multiple nodes for production usage" type={"warn"}>

    A functioning HA setup require at least **3** nodes to work, or use **2** for a semi-HA setup

</Callout>



------

## Disk

Pigsty will use `/data` as the default data directory, if you have a dedicate main data disk, it is recommended to mount it there,
and use `/data1`, `/data2`, `/dataN` for extra disk drivers.

<Callout title="Mount disks elsewhere?" type={"warn"}>

If you are mount it elsewhere, you'll have to change the following parameters accordingly:

| Name | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| [`node_data`](/docs/node/param#node_data_dir) | node main data directory | `/data` |
| [`pg_fs_main`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_fs_main) | postgres main data directory | `/data` |
| [`pg_fs_bkup`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_fs_bkup) | postgres backup data directory | `/data/backups` |
| [`etcd_data`](/docs/etcd/param#etcd_data) | etcd data directory | `/data/etcd` |
| [`prometheus_data`](/docs/infra/param#prometheus_data) | prometheus data directory | `/data/prometheus` |
| [`loki_data`](/docs/infra/param#loki_data) | loki data directory | `/data/loki` |
| [`minio_data`](/docs/minio/param#minio_data) | minio data directory | `/data/minio` |
| [`redis_data`](/docs/redis/param#redis_data) | redis data directory | `/data/redis` |

</Callout>





--------

## Network

Pigsty requires **static network** to work, you should explicitly assign a **fixed** IPv4 address for each node.

<Callout title="Don't have a fixed IP?" type="info">

    The `127.0.0.1` could be used as a workaround in case of no fixed IP address in one-node installation.

</Callout>

The IP address will be used as the node's **unique identifier**, it should be the primary IP address bind to the primary network interface used for **internal** network communications.

<Callout title="Never use Public IP as identifier" type="error"></Callout>

<Callout title="L2 VIP require L2 Networking" type="warn">

    To use the optional Node VIP and PG VIP features, ensure all nodes are located within the same L2 network

</Callout>




--------

## Firewall

Your security policy and firewall setup should allow access to the required ports.

To access the WebUI services, you'll have to allow the HTTP (`80`) / HTTPS (`443`) access.

To access the PostgreSQL database services, you'll have to allow the `5432` port for postgres.

<Callout title="You may access postgres services via other ports" type={"warn"}>

- `5432`: PostgreSQL database
- `6432`: Pgbouncer Connection Pooler
- `5433`: PG Primary Service
- `5434`: PG Replica Service
- `5436`: PG Default Service
- `5438`: PG Offline Service

If you are accessing the postgres services via other ports, allow them accordingly

</Callout>


In a typical public cloud VPS setup, port `22/80/443/5432` are usually opened.

<Callout title="Expose database ports with caution" type={"warn"}>

    Exposing database service ports directly to the Internet is very dangerous.
    If you need to do this, consider consulting [Security Best Practices](/docs/setup/security/) and proceed with caution.

</Callout>

In a typical production setup, port `22/80/443` are opened to DBA/OPS from LAN / Jumpserver. 
And other ports are accessed from intranet. You have to make sure they are opened internally: [used ports](/docs/node/concept).





------

## Linux OS

Pigsty runs on <span className="text-xl text-amber-500 font-black">Linux</span> Operating System, it support **10** mainstream linux distros: [**Compatible OS List**](/docs/setup/linux)

We recommend using **RockyLinux 9.4**, **Debian 12.10**, or **Ubuntu 24.04.5** as the default OS options.

<Callout title="Run pigsty on macOS?" type={"info"}>

You can install pigsty on macOS, and initiate control from your local laptop with `ansible`. (use as admin node)
But the database / infra / node / etcd services are still running on Linux nodes.

</Callout>

We **strongly recommend** using a clean installed OS environment with `en_US` set as the primary language.

<Callout title="How to enable en_US locale?" type={"info"}>

To ensure the `en_US` locale is available when using other primary language:

```bash
localedef -i en_US -f UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8
localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

</Callout>


Pigsty **DOES NOT** using containers, main componets are packed for specific distro major version.

<Callout title="Use the same OS version on all nodes" type={"warn"}>

Please use the same major and minor version of the OS on all nodes in a single deployment.

</Callout>

## Admin User

Pigsty setup everything with `ssh` and `sudo`

You’ll need an “**admin user**” on all nodes where Pigsty is meant to be deployed — an OS user with nopass `ssh` login and nopass `sudo` permissions.

On the nodes where Pigsty is installed, you need an “**administrative user**” who has nopass `ssh` login and nopass `sudo` permissions.

No password `sudo` is required to execute commands during the installation process, such as installing packages, configuring system settings, etc.

#### How to configure nopass sudo for admin user?

Assuming your admin username is `vagrant`, you can create a file in `/etc/sudoers.d/vagrant` and add the following content:

```bash
%vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

This will allow the `vagrant` user to execute all commands without a sudo password. If your username is not `vagrant`, replace `vagrant` in the above steps with your username.

#### Avoid using the root user

While it is possible to install Pigsty using the `root` user, we do not recommend it.

We recommend using a dedicated admin user, such as `dba`, different from the root user (`root`) and the database superuser (`postgres`).

There is a dedicated playbook subtask that can use an existing admin user (e.g., `root`) with ssh/sudo password input to [create](https://pigsty.io/docs/node/admin/#create-admin) a dedicated admin user.

------

## SSH Permission

In addition to nopass `sudo` privilege, Pigsty also requires the admin user to have nopass `ssh` login privilege (login via ssh key).

For [single-host installations](https://pigsty.io/docs/concept/arch/#singleton-meta) setup, this means the admin user on the local node should be able to log in to the host itself via ssh without a password.

If your Pigsty deployment involves multiple nodes, this means the admin user on the [admin node](https://pigsty.io/docs/node/#admin-node) should be able to log in to all nodes managed by Pigsty (including the local node) via ssh without a password, and execute `sudo` commands without a password as well.

During the [**`configure`**](https://pigsty.io/docs/setup/install/#configuration) procedure, if your current admin user does not have any SSH key, it will attempt to address this issue by generating a new `id_rsa` key pair and adding it to the local `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file to ensure local SSH login capability for the local admin user.

By default, Pigsty creates an admin user `dba` (`uid=88`) on all managed nodes. If you are already using this user, we recommend that you change the [`node_admin_username`](https://pigsty.io/docs/node/param/#node_admin_username) to a new username with a different uid, or disable it using the [`node_admin_enabled`](https://pigsty.io/docs/node/param/#node_admin_enabled) parameter.

#### How to configure nopass SSH login for admin user?

Assuming your admin username is `vagrant`, execute the following command as the `vagrant` user will generate a public/private key pair for login. If a key pair already exists, there is no need to generate a new one.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -q
```

The generated public key is by default located at: `/home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, and the private key at: `/home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa`. If your OS username is not `vagrant`, replace `vagrant` in the above commands with your username.

You should append the public key file (`id_rsa.pub`) to the `authorized_keys` file of the user you need to log into: `/home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys`. If you already have password access to the remote machine, you can use `ssh-copy-id` to copy the public key:

```bash
ssh-copy-id <ip>                        # Enter password to complete public key copying
sshpass -p <password> ssh-copy-id <ip>  # Or: you can embed the password directly in the command to avoid interactive password entry (cautious!)
```

Pigsty recommends provisioning the admin user during node provisioning and making it viable by default.

------

## SSH Accessibility

If your environment has some restrictions on SSH access, such as a bastion server or ad hoc firewall rules that prevent simple SSH access via `ssh <ip>`, consider using SSH aliases.

For example, if there’s a node with IP `10.10.10.10` that can not be accessed directly via ssh but can be accessed via an ssh alias `meta` defined in `~/.ssh/config`, then you can configure the `ansible_host` parameter for that node in the [**inventory**](https://pigsty.io/docs/setup/config/#inventory) to specify the SSH Alias on the host level:

```yaml
nodes:
  hosts:  # 10.10.10.10 can not be accessed directly via ssh, but can be accessed via ssh alias 'meta'
    10.10.10.10: { ansible_host: meta }
```

If the ssh alias does not meet your requirement, there are a plethora of custom [**ssh connection parameters**](https://docs.ansible.com/archive/ansible/2.4/intro_inventory.html#list-of-behavioral-inventory-parameters) that can bring fine-grained control over SSH connection behavior.

If the following cmd can be successfully executed on the admin node by the admin user, it means that the target node’s admin user is properly configured.

```bash
ssh <ip|alias> 'sudo ls'
```

------

## Software

On the [**admin node**](https://pigsty.io/docs/node/concept/#admin-node), Pigsty requires [**`ansible`**](https://pigsty.io/docs/setup/playbook/#ansible) to initiate control. If you are using the singleton meta installation, Ansible is required on this node. It is not required for common nodes.

The [**`bootstrap`**](https://pigsty.io/docs/setup/offline/#bootstrap) procedure will make every effort to do this for you. But you can always choose to install Ansible manually. The process of manually installing Ansible varies with different OS distros / major versions (usually involving an additional weak dependency `jmespath`):

- Install Ansible
- EL 8 / 9
- EL 7
- Debian / Ubuntu
- MacOS

```bash
sudo dnf install -y ansible python3.12-jmespath
```

To install Pigsty, you also need to prepare the Pigsty source package. You can directly download a specific version from the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/releases/) page or use the following command to obtain the latest stable version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.io/get | bash
```

If your env does not have Internet access, consider using the [**offline packages**](https://pigsty.io/docs/setup/offline/#offline-packages), which are pre-packed for different OS distros, and can be downloaded from the GitHub Release page.
