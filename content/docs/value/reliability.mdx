--------

## High-Availability: Reliable PostgreSQL RDS

> Delivers PG HA solutions following industry best practices.\
> Adjustable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

- Primary failover metrics: RTO ≈ 30 seconds (adjustable)
- Async commit mode: RPO < 1MB, crit mode: RPO = 0
- Replica failure / switchover: RTO ≈ 0 seconds

--------

## Self-Healing: Adaptive Service Failover

> Self-healing architecture with transparent topology and multi-writer experience.\
> Automatic traffic routing based on health checks and flexible access methods.

- Industry HA best practices: Patroni, Etcd, HAProxy, VIP Manager
- 4 default services with read-write splitting
- Automatic traffic routing based on health checks
- Flexible access methods: IP, Connection Pools, L2 VIP, L4 LB

--------

## PITR Protection: Pre-configured Backup & Archives

> Pre-configures physical backups and enables WAL archiving by default.\
> Protection against software defects and human errors with incremental recovery.

- Industry backup best practices: pgBackRest + MinIO/Local Disk/S3
- Protection against software defects and human errors
- One-command backup and restore
- In-place concurrent incremental PITR

--------

## Infra Closure: No External Dependencies

> Complete PostgreSQL RDS infrastructure requiring no external dependencies.\
> All critical services included for self-contained operation.

- Observability infrastructure: Prometheus / Grafana
- Load balancing: Nginx / HAProxy
- Configuration storage: Etcd / MinIO
- Critical services: DNSMasq / Chronyd

--------

## Access Control: Built-in Best-Practice Model

> Default ACL with read/write/admin/analytics/monitoring/DBA separation.\
> Secure configuration out of the box with role-based access control.

- Default roles: readonly / readwrite / admin / offline
- Default users: DBSU / DBA / replication / monitoring
- Default HBA rule sets
- Managed pgbouncer db/user credentials

--------

## Confidentiality: Guaranteed Data Security

> Self-signed CA, SSL encryption, password for backups and endpoints\
> As long as your passwords & key are secure, your data remains safe.

- Local CA-issued certificates with SSL/TLS enabled globally by default
- SCRAM-SHA-256 verification, AES-encrypted backup data
- Precise allow/deny list default policies to prevent unauthorized access
- All externally exposed web services are uniformly managed through Nginx

--------

## Data Integrity: Thorough Verification

> Data checksums for silent corruption. Replicas and delayed standby instances.\
> Audit extensions and centralized logging, with transparency and efficiency.

- CRIT configuration template: optimized for data integrity
- Data checksums enabled to prevent silent data corruption
- WatchDog: STONITH to prevent cluster split-brain
- Audit Log: centrally collected, tamper-proof

--------

## Battle-Tested: Availability Results

> Running robustly in many large organizations, maintain 99.999%+ availability.
> Ultimate business continuity: rolling upgrades, switchovers, and online migrations

- No single points of failure: Redundant HA designs for all critical components
- Zero-downtime migration based on logical replication blue-green deployment
- Emergency plans: standard SOPs for various failure scenarios
- Benchmark case: 25,000 vCPU x six years x 99.999% availability
