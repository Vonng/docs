## Monitoring Infra: Built-in Observability Stack


> Ready-to-use Prometheus & Grafana observability tech stack\
> Automatic target discovery. Enterprise-grade monitoring without configure

- Time-series database: Prometheus / AlertManager / X Exporters
- Visualization: Grafana, Echarts, plus ten extra panels/data sources
- Log collection: Loki / Promtail, or VictoriaMetrics / Vector


--------

## Data-Driven: Measure what you Manage

> Monitoring built with data analytics and BI principles, turn metrics into insights\
> From macro overview to micro details, solid data support for administration

- 3000+ metrics, 666 pre-agg rules, collecting all possible observation points
- Unified labels for cross correlation, multi-level dashboard with nav links
- Laying solid data context for intelligent AIOPS — [《D-Bot LLM as DBA》](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01454)

--------

## SOTA Experience: The Definitive PG monitoring

> Five years of refinement for the ultimate PG monitoring experience.\
> Dig into tables, indexes, func, and query objects details

- Global/cluster/instance/database/object 5-levels, roll-up / drill-down easily
- Historical metrics of tables, indexes, functions, queries and other DB objects
- [pg_exporter](https://github.com/Vonng/pg_exporter) for postgres/pgbouncer metrics, fully customizable with YAML

--------

## Universal Monitoring: RDS or Compat Kernels

> Monitoring cloud RDS PG or existing PG-compatible kernels\
> Monitoring nodes, dbms, apps, LB with correlation analysis

- Monitoring cloud vendors' RDS and PG-compatible kernel like Aurora
- Built-in support for: Node, Infra, MinIO, Etcd, Redis, Haproxy, Nginx…
- General monitoring solution for servers and other app, easy to integrate

--------

## Automatic Alerts: No more manual checks

> Production-tested preset alert rule sets with automatic event notification\
> AlertManager integration: aggregation, silencing, IM connectivity

- AlertManager integration: aggregation, silencing, IM connectivity
- 56 preset alert rules covering all built-in Pigsty modules
- Alert info links to dashboards, improve fault diagnosis efficiency

--------

## Performance Tuning: Slow-query Optimize

> Combine metrics & catalogs to identify and optimize slow queries quickly\
> Dashboards for query details, with quantifiable comparison results

- pg_stat_statements for historical slow query key metrics
- auto_explain records slow query execution plans and visualizes with PEV
- Use PGCAT to read and visualize PG catalog related data

--------

## Log Analysis: Fast root-cause detection

> Unified log collection system with Loki and Promtail, sys db log in one place\
> Search and filter logs with massive parallel grep, fast and efficient

- All log streams in one place, associated through labels, flexible search criteria
- Use PromQL to extract additional metrics from logs, such as error rates
- Use PGLOG application for interactive analysis of specific PG CSV log samples

--------

## Custom Dashboards: Low-code Data App

> PostgreSQL + Grafana + Echarts + VolkovLabs datasources/panels\
> Create interactive data app, quickly build prototypes and visualization demos

- WHO COVID-19 pandemic data visualization
- ISD global landmark weather station data visualization
- StackOverflow database file survey
