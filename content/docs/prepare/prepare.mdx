You can leverage [**Terraform**](/docs/setup/terraform) and [**Vagrant**](/docs/setup/vagrant) tempaltes to help you prepare the environment easily.
But in case you want/have to do it manually, this page will help you prepare the environment for pigsty.


--------

## Node

Pigsty currently runs on nodes with [`Linux`](#linux-os) kernel and `x86_64` / `aarch64` architecture.

A "**node**" refers to a resource that is SSH [accessible](#accessibility) and offers a bare Linux OS environment.
It could be a physical machine, a virtual machine, or a OS-like container equipped with `systemd`, `sudo` and `sshd`.

It requires at least <span className="text-xl font-black"> 1 </span> node to deploy pigsty,
You can prepare more and setup everything in [one-pass](/docs/setup/playbook#deployment), or add them later.
The minimum node spec requirement is `1C1G`, it is recommended to use at least `2C2G`.
Higher is better, with no upper limit. Parameters will be automatically tuned based on available resource.

<Callout title="Use multiple nodes for production usage" type={"info"}>

    A functioning HA setup require at least **3** nodes to work, or use **2** for a semi-HA setup

</Callout>



------

## Disk

Pigsty will use `/data` as the default data directory, if you have a dedicate main data disk, it is recommended to mount it there,
and use `/data1`, `/data2`, `/dataN` for extra disk drivers.

<Callout title="Mount disks elsewhere?" type={"warn"}>

If you are mount it elsewhere, you'll have to change the following parameters accordingly:

| Name | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| [`node_data`](/docs/node/param#node_data_dir) | node main data directory | `/data` |
| [`pg_fs_main`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_fs_main) | postgres main data directory | `/data` |
| [`pg_fs_bkup`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_fs_bkup) | postgres backup data directory | `/data/backups` |
| [`etcd_data`](/docs/etcd/param#etcd_data) | etcd data directory | `/data/etcd` |
| [`prometheus_data`](/docs/infra/param#prometheus_data) | prometheus data directory | `/data/prometheus` |
| [`loki_data`](/docs/infra/param#loki_data) | loki data directory | `/data/loki` |
| [`minio_data`](/docs/minio/param#minio_data) | minio data directory | `/data/minio` |
| [`redis_data`](/docs/redis/param#redis_data) | redis data directory | `/data/redis` |

</Callout>





--------

## Network

Pigsty requires **static network** to work, you should explicitly assign a **fixed** IPv4 address for each node.

<Callout title="Don't have a fixed IP?" type="info">

    The `127.0.0.1` could be used as a workaround in case of no fixed IP address in one-node installation.

</Callout>

The IP address will be used as the node's **unique identifier**, it should be the primary IP address bind to the primary network interface used for **internal** network communications.

<Callout title="Never use Public IP as identifier" type="error">

    Using public IP addresses as node identifiers can cause security and connectivity issues.

</Callout>

<Callout title="L2 VIP require L2 Networking" type="warn">

    To use the optional Node VIP and PG VIP features, ensure all nodes are located within the same L2 network

</Callout>




--------

## Firewall

Your security policy and firewall setup should allow access to the required ports.

To access the WebUI services, you'll have to allow the HTTP (`80`) / HTTPS (`443`) access.

To access the PostgreSQL database services, you'll have to allow the `5432` port for postgres.

<Callout title="You may access postgres services via other ports" type={"warn"}>

- `5432`: PostgreSQL database
- `6432`: Pgbouncer Connection Pooler
- `5433`: PG Primary Service
- `5434`: PG Replica Service
- `5436`: PG Default Service
- `5438`: PG Offline Service

If you are accessing the postgres services via other ports, allow them accordingly

</Callout>


In a typical public cloud VPS setup, port `22/80/443/5432` are usually opened.

<Callout title="Expose database ports with caution" type={"warn"}>

    Exposing database service ports directly to the Internet is very dangerous.
    If you need to do this, consider consulting [Security Best Practices](/docs/setup/security/) and proceed with caution.

</Callout>

In a typical production setup, port `22/80/443` are opened to DBA/OPS from LAN / Jumpserver. 
And other ports are accessed from intranet. You have to make sure they are opened internally: [used ports](/docs/node/concept).





------

## Linux OS

Pigsty runs on <span className="text-xl text-amber-500 font-black">Linux</span> Operating System, it support **10** mainstream linux distros: [**Compatible OS List**](/docs/setup/linux)

We recommend using **RockyLinux 9.4**, **Debian 12.10**, or **Ubuntu 24.04.5** as the default OS options.

<Callout title="Run pigsty on macOS?" type={"info"}>

You can install pigsty on macOS, and initiate control from your local laptop with `ansible`. (use as admin node)
But the database / infra / node / etcd services are still running on Linux nodes.

</Callout>

We **strongly recommend** using a clean installed OS environment with `en_US` set as the primary language.

<Callout title="How to enable en_US locale?" type={"info"}>

To ensure the `en_US` locale is available when using other primary language:

```bash
localedef -i en_US -f UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8
localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

</Callout>


Pigsty **DOES NOT** using containers, main componets are packed for specific distro major version.

<Callout title="Use the same OS version on all nodes" type={"warn"}>

Please use the same major and minor version of the OS on all nodes in a single deployment.

</Callout>




------

## Admin User

Pigsty requires an OS **admin user** with passwordless `ssh` and `sudo` privileges on all managed nodes.

A user can `ssh` to all nodes from admin node, and execute `sudo` commands there without password.

<Callout title="Allow sudo without password" type="info">

    To manully allow an user to execute `sudo` commands without password:

    Create a sudoers file for your admin user (replace `vagrant` placeholders with your username):

    ```bash
    echo '%vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant
    ```

</Callout>

<Callout title="Don't use postgres dbsu as admin user" type="error">

    DBSU (`postgres` by default)  should NOT be used as admin user.
    It will cause unexpected security issues.

</Callout>

<Callout title="Avoid using root user" type="warn">

    While possible, using `root` as admin user is not recommended for security reasons.

</Callout>



------

## Nopass SSH

You'll need nopass `ssh` access to all managed nodes, for admin user @ admin node, including localhost.

You have to configure public key auth if you don't want to input password manully for every task.

<Callout title="Generate SSH Key" type="info">

    Generate an SSH key pair if one doesn't exist:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -q
    ```

    Pigsty will do that for you if you don't have a key pair, during `bootstrap` stage.

</Callout>


<Callout title="Distribute your ssh key to other nodes" type="info">

    Copy the public key to all managed nodes, `ssh-copy-id` or add to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` manually.

    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id <ip>                        # Interactive password entry
    sshpass -p <password> ssh-copy-id <ip>  # Non-interactive (use with caution)
    ```

</Callout>




------

## Accessibility

Make sure your admin user can access all managed nodes with nopass `ssh` and nopass `sudo`.

<Callout title="Verify nopass ssh sudo is working" type="info">

    Run this command on admin node to all managed nodes:

    ```bash
    ssh <ip|alias> 'sudo ls'
    ```
    
    if there's no password prompt or error raised, nopass ssh/sudo is working as expected.

</Callout>

When direct ssh access is not available (due to jumpserver, other port, credentials, etc...), consider alias:

<Callout title="Using SSH aliases" type="info">

    Configure SSH aliases in `~/.ssh/config` and reference the alias in the inventory.

    ```yaml
    nodes:       
      hosts:          # if node `10.10.10.10` requires an SSH alias `meta`
        10.10.10.10: { ansible_host: meta }  # <---- access via `ssh meta`
    ```

    Check [Ansible Inventory Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html#connecting-to-hosts-behavioral-inventory-parameters) for all available parameters and details.

</Callout>

While it's user's responsibility to create an admin user during provisioning stage.
You can create admin user with pigsty itself, with existing root/admin user:

<Callout title="Create admin user on other nodes with existing user" type="info">

    This will create a dedicate `dba` (uid) user with sudo / ssh properly configured.

    ```bash
    ./node.yml -k -K -e ansible_user=<another_admin> -t node_admin
    ```

    | Name | Description | Default |
    |------|-------------|---------|
    | [`node_admin_enabled`](/docs/node/param#node_admin_enabled) | enable node admin user | `true` |
    | [`node_admin_uid`](/docs/node/param#node_admin_uid) | uid of node admin user | `88` |
    | [`node_admin_username`](/docs/node/param#node_admin_username) | name of node admin user | `dba` |

</Callout>




--------

## Ansible

Pigsty use `ansible` to initiate control from admin node to all managed nodes.

You don't need to care about details, ansible is installed during the [**Bootstrap**](/docs/setup/offline#bootstrap) stage.

<Callout title="Install Ansible Manually" type="info">

    ```bash tab="EL 8/9"
    sudo dnf install -y ansible python3.12-jmespath
    ```
    ```bash tab="Debian / Ubuntu"
    sudo apt install -y ansible python3-jmespath
    ```
    ```bash tab="EL 7"
    sudo yum install -y ansible python-jmespath
    ```
    ```bash tab="macOS"
    brew install ansible
    pip3 install jmespath
    ```

</Callout>

Ansible is only required on admin node, you can run ansible on macOS to use your laptop as admin node. 


--------

## Pigsty

You can get pigsty src and pkg from the official [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/releases)

<Callout title="Get the latest stable version" type="info">

```bash
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.io/get | bash
```

</Callout>

<Callout title="Get a specific version" type="info">

```bash
