ETCD is a distributed, reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system

[Configuration](/docs/etcd/#configuration) | [Administration](/docs/etcd/#administration) | [Playbook](/docs/etcd/#playbook) | [Dashboard](/docs/etcd/#dashboard) | [Parameter](/docs/etcd/#parameter)

Pigsty use [**etcd**](https://etcd.io/) as [**DCS**](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dcs_failsafe_mode.html): Distributed configuration storage (or distributed consensus service). Which is critical to PostgreSQL High-Availability & Auto-Failover.

You have to install [`ETCD`](/docs/etcd/) module before any [`PGSQL`](/docs/pgsql/) modules, since patroni & vip-manager will rely on etcd to work. Unless you are using an external etcd cluster.

You donâ€™t need [`NODE`](/docs/node/) module to install [`ETCD`](/docs/etcd/), but it requires a valid `CA` on your local `files/pki/ca`. Check [ETCD Administration SOP](/docs/etcd/#administration) for more details.
