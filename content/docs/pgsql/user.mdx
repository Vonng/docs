> In this context, **User** refers to **logical objects** created by SQL `CREATE USER/ROLE` commands.

In PostgreSQL, users belong directly to the database cluster, not to specific databases.

Therefore, when creating business databases and users, you should follow the principle of **“users first, then databases”**.

------

## Define User

Pigsty defines roles and users in database clusters through two config parameters, both in the form of arrays of user objects:

- [`pg_default_roles`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_default_roles) : Define system-wide roles & global users
- [`pg_users`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_users) : Define business users & roles at cluster level

The former defines roles and users shared across the entire environment, while the latter defines business roles and users specific to a single cluster.

```yaml
pg-meta:
  hosts: { 10.10.10.10: { pg_seq: 1, pg_role: primary } }
  vars:
    pg_cluster: pg-meta
    pg_databases:
      - {name: dbuser_meta     ,password: DBUser.Meta     ,pgbouncer: true ,roles: [dbrole_admin]    ,comment: pigsty admin user }
      - {name: dbuser_view     ,password: DBUser.Viewer   ,pgbouncer: true ,roles: [dbrole_readonly] ,comment: read-only viewer for meta database }
      - {name: dbuser_grafana  ,password: DBUser.Grafana  ,pgbouncer: true ,roles: [dbrole_admin]    ,comment: admin user for grafana database    }
      - {name: dbuser_bytebase ,password: DBUser.Bytebase ,pgbouncer: true ,roles: [dbrole_admin]    ,comment: admin user for bytebase database   }
      - {name: dbuser_kong     ,password: DBUser.Kong     ,pgbouncer: true ,roles: [dbrole_admin]    ,comment: admin user for kong api gateway    }
      - {name: dbuser_gitea    ,password: DBUser.Gitea    ,pgbouncer: true ,roles: [dbrole_admin]    ,comment: admin user for gitea service       }
      - {name: dbuser_wiki     ,password: DBUser.Wiki     ,pgbouncer: true ,roles: [dbrole_admin]    ,comment: admin user for wiki.js service     }
      - {name: dbuser_noco     ,password: DBUser.Noco     ,pgbouncer: true ,roles: [dbrole_admin]    ,comment: admin user for nocodb service      }
```

And each user definition may look like:

```yaml
- name: dbuser_meta               # REQUIRED, `name` is the only mandatory field of a user definition
  password: DBUser.Meta           # optional, password, can be a scram-sha-256 hash string or plain text
  login: true                     # optional, can log in, true by default  (new biz ROLE should be false)
  superuser: false                # optional, is superuser? false by default
  createdb: false                 # optional, can create database? false by default
  createrole: false               # optional, can create role? false by default
  inherit: true                   # optional, can this role use inherited privileges? true by default
  replication: false              # optional, can this role do replication? false by default
  bypassrls: false                # optional, can this role bypass row level security? false by default
  pgbouncer: true                 # optional, add this user to pgbouncer user-list? false by default (production user should be true explicitly)
  connlimit: -1                   # optional, user connection limit, default -1 disable limit
  expire_in: 3650                 # optional, now + n days when this role is expired (OVERWRITE expire_at)
  expire_at: '2030-12-31'         # optional, YYYY-MM-DD 'timestamp' when this role is expired  (OVERWRITTEN by expire_in)
  comment: pigsty admin user      # optional, comment string for this user/role
  roles: [dbrole_admin]           # optional, belonged roles. default roles are: dbrole_{admin,readonly,readwrite,offline}
  parameters: {}                  # optional, role level parameters with `ALTER ROLE SET`
  pool_mode: transaction          # optional, pgbouncer pool mode at user level, transaction by default
  pool_connlimit: -1              # optional, max database connections at user level, default -1 disable limit
  search_path: public             # key value config parameters according to postgresql documentation (e.g: use pigsty as default search_path)
```

- The only **required** field is `name`, which should be a valid & unique username in PostgreSQL.
- Roles don’t need a `password`, while it could be necessary for a login-able user.
- The `password` can be plain text or a scram-sha-256 / md5 hash string.
- User/Role are created one by one in array order. So make sure role/group definition is ahead of its members
- `login`, `superuser`, `createdb`, `createrole`, `inherit`, `replication`, `bypassrls` are boolean flags
- `pgbouncer` is disabled by default. To add a business user to the pgbouncer user-list, you should set it to `true` explicitly.

**ACL System**

Pigsty has a battery-included [ACL](/docs/pgsql/acl) system, which can be easily used by assigning roles to users:

- `dbrole_readonly` : The role for global read-only access
- `dbrole_readwrite` : The role for global read-write access
- `dbrole_admin` : The role for object creation
- `dbrole_offline` : The role for restricted read-only access ([offline](/docs/pgsql/config/#offline) instance)

If you wish to re-design your ACL system, check the following parameters & templates.

- [`pg_default_roles`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_default_roles) : System-wide roles & global users
- [`pg_default_privileges`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_default_privileges) : Default privileges for newly created objects
- [`roles/pgsql/templates/pg-init-role.sql`](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/blob/main/roles/pgsql/templates/pg-init-role.sql): Role creation SQL template
- [`roles/pgsql/templates/pg-init-template.sql`](https://github.com/pgsty/pigsty/blob/main/roles/pgsql/templates/pg-init-template.sql): Privilege SQL template

## Create User

Users and roles defined in [`pg_default_roles`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_default_roles) and [`pg_users`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_users) will be automatically created one by one during cluster initialization.

If you want to [**create users**](/docs/pgsql/admin/#创建用户) on an existing cluster, you can use the `bin/pgsql-user` command line or directly use the [`pgsql-user.yml`](/docs/pgsql/playbook/#pgsql-useryml) playbook.

Add new user/role definitions to `all.children.<cls>.pg_users`, and create the database using one of the following methods:

```bash
bin/pgsql-user <cls> <username>                        # using command line
./pgsql-user.yml -l <cls> -e username=<username>       # using playbook
```

Unlike databases, the user creation playbook is always idempotent. When the target user already exists, Pigsty will modify the user’s attributes to match the configuration.

#### Use Playbook for User Creation

We do not recommend manually creating new business users, especially when the users you want to create use the default pgbouncer connection pool: unless you are willing to manually maintain the user list in Pgbouncer and keep it in sync with PostgreSQL.

When creating new databases using the **`bin/pgsql-user`** tool or [**`pgsql-user.yml`**](/docs/pgsql/playbook/#pgsql-useryml) playbook, the database will also be added to the [Pgbouncer Users](/docs/pgsql/user/#pgbouncer用户) list.

------

## Modify User

The method to modify PostgreSQL user attributes is the same as [**creating users**](/docs/pgsql/user/#创建用户).

First, adjust your user definition by modifying the attributes you want to change, then execute the following command to apply:

```bash
bin/pgsql-user <cls> <username>                        # using command line
./pgsql-user.yml -l <cls> -e username=<username>       # using playbook
```

Note that modifying a user does not delete the user, but modifies user attributes using the `ALTER USER` command; it also does not revoke user permissions and group memberships, and uses the `GRANT` command to grant new roles.

------

## Delete User

For security reasons, Pigsty does not automatically delete users, even if you remove user definitions from the configuration, Pigsty will not delete existing users.

You need to use the SQL command `DROP USER` to manually delete users:

```sql
DROP USER "<username>";
```

If the role you want to delete is a group (has other users belonging to it), you need to first remove other users from the group before deleting the group:

```sql
REVOKE "<rolename>" FROM "<other_user>";
```

If the user you want to delete **owns** database objects, you need to first change the ownership of these objects to another user before deleting the user:

```sql
REASSIGN OWNED BY "<username>" TO "<another_user>";
```

------

## Pgbouncer Users

Pigsty installs and enables Pgbouncer connection pool by default and manages users in the connection pool.

Pigsty will by default add users with the `pgbouncer: true` flag in [`pg_users`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_users) to the pgbouncer user list.

### Configuration Files

Users in the Pgbouncer connection pool are listed in `/etc/pgbouncer/userlist.txt`:

```ini
"postgres" ""
"dbuser_wiki" "SCRAM-SHA-256$4096:+77dyhrPeFDT/TptHs7/7Q==$KeatuohpKIYzHPCt/tqBu85vI11o9mar/by0hHYM2W8=:X9gig4JtjoS8Y/o1vQsIX/gY1Fns8ynTXkbWOjUfbRQ="

```

User-level connection pool parameters are maintained in a separate file: `/etc/pgbouncer/useropts.txt`, for example:

```ini
dbuser_dba                  = pool_mode=session max_user_connections=16
dbuser_monitor              = pool_mode=session max_user_connections=8
```

The connection pool user configuration files `userlist.txt` and `useropts.txt` will be automatically refreshed when you [create users](/docs/pgsql/user/#创建用户) and take effect through online configuration reload, normally without affecting existing connections.

When you [create databases](/docs/pgsql/database/#创建数据库), the Pgbouncer database list definition file will be refreshed and take effect through online configuration reload, without affecting existing connections.

### Manage Users

Pgbouncer runs with the same `dbsu` as PostgreSQL, defaulting to the `postgres` operating system user. You can use the `pgb` alias to access pgbouncer management functions using dbsu.

```bash
sudo su - postgres
pgb   # login to pgbouncer command line interface using admin user
```

Pigsty also provides a utility function `pgb-route` that can quickly switch pgbouncer database traffic to other nodes in the cluster, useful for zero-downtime migration:

### Delete Users

For security reasons, Pigsty does not provide commands to delete database/connection pool users by default.

To remove a user from the pgbouncer connection pool, simply delete the corresponding line from the configuration file and reload pgbouncer.

The connection pool user list is managed through full refresh coverage. If you ensure all database users are created by Pigsty playbooks/command line, you can use the following command to fully refresh and overwrite the user list in the pgbouncer connection pool:

```bash
./pgsql.yml -t pgbouncer_user,pgbouncer_reload -e pg_reload=true
```

### Dynamic User Authentication

Note that the [`pgbouncer_auth_query`](/docs/pgsql/param#pgbouncer_auth_query) parameter allows you to use dynamic queries to complete connection pool user authentication, which is a compromise when you don’t want to manage users in the connection pool.
