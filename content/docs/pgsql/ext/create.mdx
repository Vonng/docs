## Quick Start

After [**installing**](/docs/pgsql/ext/install/) PostgreSQL extensions, you can enable (create) them using the [**`CREATE EXTENSION`**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) statement:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;      -- Enable vector database extension (no explicit loading required)
CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb; -- Enable time-series database extension (explicit loading required)
```

Some extensions have dependencies on other extensions. In such cases, you can either install the dependencies first or use the `CREATE EXTENSION CASCADE` command to install all dependencies at once.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION documentdb CASCADE; -- create documentdb extension and all its dependencies
```

You can also specify the schema and specific version in the command.

## Configure

Extensions (database logical objects) are logically part of [**PostgreSQL databases**](/docs/pgsql/db/). In Pigsty, you can specify which extensions to be created in a database using [**`pg_databases`**](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_databases).

```yaml
pg_databases:
  - name: postgres
    baseline: supabase.sql
    schemas: [ extensions ,auth ,realtime ,storage ,graphql_public ,supabase_functions ,_analytics ,_realtime ]
    extensions:                                 # Extensions to be enabled in the postgres database
      - { name: pgcrypto  ,schema: extensions } # cryptographic functions
      - { name: pg_net    ,schema: extensions } # async HTTP
      - { name: pgjwt     ,schema: extensions } # json web token API for postgres
      - { name: uuid-ossp ,schema: extensions } # generate universally unique identifiers (UUIDs)
      - { name: pgsodium        }               # pgsodium is a modern cryptography library for Postgres.
      - { name: supabase_vault  }               # Supabase Vault Extension
      - { name: pg_graphql      }               # pg_graphql: GraphQL support
      - { name: pg_jsonschema   }               # pg_jsonschema: Validate json schema
      - { name: wrappers        }               # wrappers: FDW collections
      - { name: http            }               # http: allows web page retrieval inside the database.
      - { name: pg_cron         }               # pg_cron: Job scheduler for PostgreSQL
      - { name: timescaledb     }               # timescaledb: Enables scalable inserts and complex queries for time-series data
      - { name: pg_tle          }               # pg_tle: Trusted Language Extensions for PostgreSQL
      - { name: vector          }               # pgvector: the vector similarity search
      - { name: pgmq            }               # pgmq: A lightweight message queue like AWS SQS and RSMQ
```

Here, the `extensions` in the database object is a list where each element can be:

- A simple string representing the extension name, such as `vector`
- A dictionary that may contain the following fields:
- `name`: The only **required field**, specifying the extension name, which may differ from the [**extension package name**](/docs/pgsql/ext/pkg).
- `schema`: Specifies the schema for installing the extension, defaults to the first schema in the current dbsu search path, usually the default `public`.
- `version`: Specifies the extension version, defaults to the latest version, rarely used.

If the database doesn’t exist yet, the extensions defined here will be automatically created when [**creating a cluster**](/docs/pgsql/admin#create-cluster) or [**creating a database**](/docs/pgsql/admin#create-database) through Pigsty.

If the database is already created, it’s recommended to manage extension through standard schema migration procedure. You can note corresponding changes in the Pigsty inventory to help future migration tasks.



------

## Default

Pigsty creates several extensions by default for managed PostgreSQL databases. These extensions are created in the default `template1` database and the `postgres` database.
Any newly created database will inherit the extension from `template1`, so you don’t need extra configure.

You can modify the default extensions list by overwriting the [**`pg_default_extensions`**](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_default_extensions).

All default extensions are built-in [**Contrib**](/ext/list/repo#contrib) extensions that come with PostgreSQL, with the sole exception of the [**`pg_repack`**](/ext/pg_repack), which is a third-party extension from PGDG.
And `pg_repack` is crucial for PostgreSQL bloat maintenance, so Pigsty installs it by default and enables it in all databases.

```yaml
pg_default_extensions:
  - { name: pg_stat_statements ,schema: monitor }
  - { name: pgstattuple        ,schema: monitor }
  - { name: pg_buffercache     ,schema: monitor }
  - { name: pageinspect        ,schema: monitor }
  - { name: pg_prewarm         ,schema: monitor }
  - { name: pg_visibility      ,schema: monitor }
  - { name: pg_freespacemap    ,schema: monitor }
  - { name: postgres_fdw       ,schema: public  }
  - { name: file_fdw           ,schema: public  }
  - { name: btree_gist         ,schema: public  }
  - { name: btree_gin          ,schema: public  }
  - { name: pg_trgm            ,schema: public  }
  - { name: intagg             ,schema: public  }
  - { name: intarray           ,schema: public  }
  - { name: pg_repack } # <-- The only 3rd-party extension created by default
```

In Pigsty’s design, monitoring-related extensions are created in the `monitor` schema, while other functional extensions are created in the `public` schema.

Additionally, the vector database extension [**`pgvector`**](/ext/vector) has a special status. It is [**installed**](/docs/pgsql/ext/install) by default in Pigsty (in the `pgsql-main` alias) and enabled in the placeholder `meta` database.

Finally, the key extension for implementing **CDC (Change Data Capture)**, the [`wal2json`](/ext/wal2json), is also installed by default, but since it’s an “[**Extension without DDL**](/docs/pgsql/ext/create#extensions-without-ddl)”, so it doesn’t appear in `pg_default_extensions`.




------

## Extensions without DDL

Not all extensions require the `CREATE EXTENSION` command to be enabled.

In principle, PostgreSQL extensions typically consist of three parts:

- Control file: Contains key metadata, **required**
- SQL file: Contains SQL statements, **optional**
- Library file: Contains binary shared libraries (`.so`, `.dylib`, `.dll`), **optional**

The `SQL` file is optional, so extensions without an `SQL` file typically don’t require executing the `CREATE EXTENSION` command to enable.

| **[LOAD](/docs/pgsql/ext/config) \ DDL** | Requires `CREATE EXTENSION` | Doesn't require `CREATE EXTENSION` |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Requires `LOAD`**                      | Extensions using hooks      | Headless extensions                |
| **Doesn’t Require `LOAD`**               | Extensions not using hooks  | Logical decoding output plugins    |

For example, the `wal2json` extension providing CDC extraction capabilities, the `pg_stat_statements` and `auto_explain` extensions providing slow query statistics.
They only have shared library files and extension `.control` files, without SQL files, so they don’t need/cannot be enabled through the `CREATE EXTENSION` command.

Note that not having a `CREATE EXTENSION` command doesn’t affect whether an extension needs to be `LOAD`.
Some extensions may not have `SQL/DDL` but still require [**explicit loading**](/docs/pgsql/ext/config), such as some security, stat, audit-related extensions.
