While most PostgreSQL extensions written in SQL can be [**directly enabled**](/docs/pgsql/ext/create/) with `CREATE EXTENSION`, extensions that provide dynamic libraries (`.so`, `.dylib`, `.dll`) have different loading requirements.

Most library-based extensions don’t need explicit loading. However, extensions using PostgreSQL’s Hook mechanism require an additional step — modifying the [`shared_preload_libraries`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#Rshared_preload_libraries) parameter and restarting the database server.

Attempting to execute `CREATE EXTENSION` without proper preloading will result in an error. And wrongly configured loading may lead to a failure on database restart/start.

------

## Quick Start

For example, in the [`conf/app/supa`](/docs/app/supabase) config template, we load multiple extensions by setting the [`pg_libs`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_libs) parameter:

```yaml
all:
  children:
    pg-meta:
      hosts: { 10.10.10.10: { pg_seq: 1, pg_role: primary } }
      vars:
        pg_cluster: pg-meta
        pg_databases:
          - name: postgres
            pg_libs: 'timescaledb, plpgsql, plpgsql_check, pg_cron, pg_net, pg_stat_statements, auto_explain, pg_tle, plan_filter'
```

Not all extensions require dynamic loading via `pg_libs` (e.g., `pgcrypto`, `pgjwt`, `vector`). For extensions requiring dynamic loading, please refer to the [**Extensions that Need Loading**](/docs/pgsql/ext/config#extensions-that-need-loading) list below.

------

## Configure

There are several ways to modify PostgreSQL cluster configuration in Pigsty:

For new clusters, configure the [`pg_libs`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_libs) parameter to specify the initial value of `shared_preload_libraries`.

Note that [`pg_libs`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_libs) only takes effect during [**cluster creation**](/docs/pgsql/admin#creating-cluster). After creation, it becomes the initial value for the PostgreSQL parameter `shared_preload_libraries`.

To modify loaded extensions in an existing cluster, use the Patroni command line to [**config cluster**](/docs/pgsql/admin#config-cluster), change `shared_preload_libraries`, and restart to apply changes.

Alternatively, you can modify `shared_preload_libraries` by editing `postgresql.conf`, using the `ALTER SYSTEM` command, or overriding it through [`pg_parameters`](/docs/pgsql/param#pg_parameters). Ensure configuration remains consistent across the cluster.

------

## Default

Pigsty preloads these two [Contrib extensions](/ext/list/repo#contrib) by default:

- [**`auto_explain`**](/ext/auto_explain): Provides automatic logging of slow query execution plans
- [**`pg_stat_statements`**](/ext/pg_stat_statements): Tracks planning and execution statistics for grouped SQL statements

These extensions are critical for query performance monitoring, which is why the default value of `pg_libs` is `pg_stat_statements, auto_explain`.

We strongly recommend retaining these extensions when configuring additional loaded modules.



------

## Caveats

In `shared_preload_libraries`, separate multiple extensions with commas:

```ini
shared_preload_libraries = 'timescaledb, pg_stat_statements, auto_explain'
```

Loading sequence can be significant. For example, [**`citus`**](/ext/citus) and [**`timescaledb`**](/ext/timescaledb) must be placed at the beginning of `shared_preload_libraries`. If using both extensions simultaneously (uncommon), place `citus` before `timescaledb`.

The full-text search plugin [**`pg_search`**](/ext/pg_search) requires explicit loading in current versions, but in PostgreSQL 17, this requirement is removed.

For the MongoDB emulation plugin [**`documentdb`**](/ext/documentdb), note that the dynamic library names differ from the extension names — use `pg_documentdb` and `pg_documentdb_core` instead.

## Extensions that Need Loading

In the [Extension List](/ext/list/), extensions marked with `LOAD` require dynamic loading and a server restart. These include:
