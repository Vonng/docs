To update an existing extension, you need to first update the RPM/DEB package in your OS’s package manager, then update the extension to the new version in PostgreSQL using the `ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE` command.

------

## Upgrade Packages

All extensions listed in [`pg_extensions`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_extensions) can be upgraded using Pigsty’s [`pgsql.yml`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/admin/) playbook:

```bash
./pgsql.yml -t pg_extension
```

This will automatically install the latest available version of extension RPM/DEB packages in your current environment.

You can also upgrade extensions with the `pig ext update` command, or using `yum/apt upgrade` directly.

```bash
yum upgrade extname...
apt upgrade extname...
```

Pigsty’s [`pig`](https://pigsty.io/ext/pig/) cli can also help you with that, without the burden of specifying full package names:

```bash
pig ext update extname...
```

------

## Alter Extension

Execute the [`ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-alterextension.html) command in the database to update the extension to the new version:

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION name UPDATE [ TO new_version ]
```

If you omit the `TO new_version` clause, the extension will be updated to the latest version available in the database.
