PGSQL for production environments is organized in **clusters**, which **clusters** are **logical entities** consisting of a set of database **instances** associated by **primary-replica**. Each **database cluster** is an autonomous serving unit consisting of at least one **database instance** (primary).

------

## ER Diagram

Let’s get started with ER diagram. There are four types of core entities in Pigsty’s PGSQL module:

- **PGSQL Cluster**: An autonomous PostgreSQL business unit, used as the top-level namespace for other entities.
- **PGSQL Service**: A named abstraction of cluster ability, route traffics, and expose postgres services with node ports.
- **PGSQL Instance**: A single postgres server which is a group of running processes & database files on a single node.
- **PGSQL Node**: An abstraction of hardware resources, which can be bare metal, virtual machine, or even k8s pods.

**Naming Convention**

- The cluster name should be a valid domain name, without any dot: `[a-zA-Z0-9-]+`
- Service name should be prefixed with cluster name, and suffixed with a single word: such as `primary`, `replica`, `offline`, `delayed`, join by `-`
- Instance name is prefixed with cluster name and suffixed with an integer, join by `-`, e.g., `${cluster}-${seq}`.
- Node is identified by its IP address, and its hostname is usually the same as the instance name since they are 1:1 deployed.

------

## Identity Parameters

Here are some common parameters used to identify PGSQL [entities](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/concept/#er-diagram): instance, service, etc…

```yaml
# pg_cluster:           #CLUSTER  # pgsql cluster name, required identity parameter
# pg_seq: 0             #INSTANCE # pgsql instance seq number, required identity parameter
# pg_role: replica      #INSTANCE # pgsql role, required, could be primary,replica,offline
# pg_instances: {}      #INSTANCE # define multiple pg instances on node in `{port:ins_vars}` format
# pg_upstream:          #INSTANCE # repl upstream ip addr for standby cluster or cascade replica
# pg_shard:             #CLUSTER  # pgsql shard name, optional identity for sharding clusters
# pg_group: 0           #CLUSTER  # pgsql shard index number, optional identity for sharding clusters
# gp_role: master       #CLUSTER  # greenplum role of this cluster, could be master or segment
pg_offline_query: false #INSTANCE # set to true to enable offline query on this instance
```

You have to assign these **identity parameters** explicitly, there’s no default value for them.

| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :------: | :---: | -------------------------------------- |
| [`pg_cluster`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_cluster) | `string` | **C** | **PG database cluster name**           |
|    [`pg_seq`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_seq)    | `number` | **I** | **PG database instance id**            |
|   [`pg_role`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_role)   |  `enum`  | **I** | **PG database instance role**          |
|  [`pg_shard`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_shard)  | `string` | **C** | **PG database shard name of cluster**  |
|  [`pg_group`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_group)  | `number` | **C** | **PG database shard index of cluster** |

- [`pg_cluster`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_cluster): It identifies the name of the cluster, which is configured at the cluster level.
- [`pg_role`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_role): Configured at the instance level, identifies the role of the ins. Only the `primary` role will be handled specially. If not filled in, the default is the `replica` role and the special `delayed` and `offline` roles.
- [`pg_seq`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_seq): Used to identify the ins within the cluster, usually with an integer number incremented from 0 or 1, which is not changed once it is assigned.
- `{{ pg_cluster }}-{{ pg_seq }}` is used to uniquely identify the ins, i.e. `pg_instance`.
- `{{ pg_cluster }}-{{ pg_role }}` is used to identify the services within the cluster, i.e. `pg_service`.
- [`pg_shard`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_shard) and [`pg_group`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_group) are used for horizontally sharding clusters, for citus & greenplum only.

[`pg_cluster`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_cluster), [`pg_role`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_role), [`pg_seq`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/param/#pg_seq) are core **identity params**, which are **required** for any Postgres cluster, and must be explicitly specified. Here’s an example:

```yaml
pg-test:
  hosts:
    10.10.10.11: {pg_seq: 1, pg_role: replica}
    10.10.10.12: {pg_seq: 2, pg_role: primary}
    10.10.10.13: {pg_seq: 3, pg_role: replica}
  vars:
    pg_cluster: pg-test
```

Here are entities & resources in this cluster

- one cluster: `pg-test`
- two roles: `primary` & `replica`
- three instances: `pg-test-1`, `pg-test-2`, `pg-test-3`
- three nodes: `10.10.10.11`, `10.10.10.12`, `10.10.10.13`
- four services:
- [`pg-test-primary`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/svc/#primary-service): Read-Write Service
- [`pg-test-replica`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/svc/#replica-service): Read-Only Service
- [`pg-test-default`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/svc/#default-service): Direct RW Service
- [`pg-test-offline`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/svc/#offline-service): Offline Read Service

And the corresponding metrics will be labeled with these identity parameters in the monitoring system (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki):

```yaml
pg_up{cls="pg-meta", ins="pg-meta-1", ip="10.10.10.10", job="pgsql"}
pg_up{cls="pg-test", ins="pg-test-1", ip="10.10.10.11", job="pgsql"}
pg_up{cls="pg-test", ins="pg-test-2", ip="10.10.10.12", job="pgsql"}
pg_up{cls="pg-test", ins="pg-test-3", ip="10.10.10.13", job="pgsql"}
```
