[Min.IO](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc/mc-mb.html): S3-Compatible Open-Source Multi-Cloud Object Storage

MinIO is an S3-compatible object storage server. Itâ€™s designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to use. It has native multi-node multi-driver HA support and can store documents, pictures, videos, and backups.

Pigsty uses MinIO as an optional PostgreSQL backup storage repo, in addition to the default local posix FS repo. If the MinIO repo is used, the `MINIO` module should be installed before any [`PGSQL`](https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/) modules. MinIO requires a trusted CA to work, so you have to install it in addition to [`NODE`](https://pigsty.io/docs/node/) module.
