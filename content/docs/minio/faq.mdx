## Fail to launch multi-node / multi-driver MinIO cluster.

In [Multi-Driver](https://pigsty.io/docs/minio/#single-node-multi-drive) or [Multi-Node](https://pigsty.io/docs/minio/#multi-node-multi-drive) mode, MinIO will refuse to start if the data dir is not a valid mount point.

Use mounted disks for MinIO data dir rather than some regular directory. You can use the regular directory only in the [single node, single drive](https://pigsty.io/docs/minio/#single-node-single-drive) mode.
