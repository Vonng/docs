Ever wished installing or upgrading PostgreSQL extensions didn't feel like digging through outdated readmes, cryptic configure scripts, or random GitHub forks & patches? The painful truth is that Postgres's richness of extension often comes at the cost of complicated setupsâ€”especially if you're juggling multiple distros or CPU architectures.

**Pig** is a Go-based package manager built to tame Postgres and its ecosystem of 420+ extensions in one fell swoop. It aims to make extensions like TimescaleDB, Citus, PGVector, and 20+ Rust extensions effortlessly accessible.

Key Features:
- Unified CLI for extension management
- Version-aligned RPM/DEB packages
- Works across Debian, Ubuntu, and RedHat
- Supports x86 & ARM architectures
- Integrates with system's native package manager
- Follows official PGDG packaging conventions

The goal is to provide a straightforward way to extend PostgreSQL without complex installation processes. As the creators suggest, "the future of Postgres is unstoppable extensibility", and Pig is designed to help unlock that potential.
